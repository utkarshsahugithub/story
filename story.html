            <h1>The <span class="animal">null</span> And The <span class="anotherAnimal">null</span></h1>
            <p>A <span class="animal">null</span> was making fun of the <span class="anotherAnimal">null</span> one day for being so slow.</p>
            <p>"Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.</p> 
            <p>"<span class="yesOrNo"></span>" replied the <span class="anotherAnimal"></span>, "but I get there <span class="speed"></span> than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it."</p> 
            <p>The <span class="animal">null</span> was much <span class="adjective">null</span> at the idea of running a race with the <span class="anotherAnimal">null</span>, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the <span class="moreAnimal">null</span>, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled, "<span class="qoute">null</span>".</p> 
            <p>The <span class="animal">null</span> was soon far out of sight, and to make the <span class="anotherAnimal"></span> feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a <span class="animal"></span>, he went off the course to practice <span class="verbs">null</span> for <span class="number">null</span> hours until the <span class="anotherAnimal">null</span> should catch up.</p>
            <p>The <span class="anotherAnimal">null</span> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the <span class="animal">null</span> was <span class="verbs">null</span>. The <span class="animal">null</span> was so caught up in <span class="verbs">null</span>; and when at last he did stop, the <span class="anotherAnimal">null</span> was near the goal. The <span class="animal">null</span> now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the <span class="anotherAnimal">null</span> in time.</p>
